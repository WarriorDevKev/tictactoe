Unbeatable TicTacToe AI w/ Minimax Algorithm

<p> 
Minimax algorithm state value
When writing the minimax algorithm, each game involves two players and game states can be evaluated as a value. One of the players is called the maximizer, because he or she wants to maximize the value of the game and the remaining player is called the minimizer.

Minimax algorithm problem specification
Given a game state, the minimax algorithm finds the decision that maximizes the minimum gain. In other words, if you assume your opponent will make decisions that minimize your gain, the algorithm finds the move that will maximize it based on the options your opponent gives you. It is assumed that the game is being played by turns and that the opponent is playing optimally, this is: at each turn a player must make a move, and this move is the best the player can make in that situation.
